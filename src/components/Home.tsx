        </h1>
        <p className="text-xl text-gray-400 mb-6">
         The #1 most trusted Attack on Titan: Revolution Value List, maintained by experienced players worldwide. We provide accurate and reliable updates based on real trading activity.
Note: This is not an official list or set of fixed prices.
Values are determined by three key factors:

Rarity – How difficult the item is to obtain.

Demand – How many players actively want it.

Player Needs – What it’s worth to the person you’re trading with.

Because of this, values can shift depending on the market. Trading is all about negotiation and finding a deal that feels fair to both sides.
